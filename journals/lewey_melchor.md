Today we are working on getting the results page to populate with the results get got from the personality quiz

We were able to get the login page with user authentication to work. If login is successful, we will redirect to the results page. If not successful, will redirect to signup page

Haven't had much time to write you,
Front end authentication can be tough, we weren't able to find a good stopping point last night, so we all fell asleep without pushing to Gitlab... this morning our camp was a mess! However, authentication is going well! We keep searching for vulnerabilities, and patching them as we go. They say tough times really bond a group of people together, and I can tell we are growing stronger as a team! We are also growing closer to a fully operational system for signing up, verifying, and logging out users of our site.
This will surely keep us from being pillaged again!

Hello again,
Our camp keeps growing larger and larger, we are beginning to amass more supplies with the help of neighboring camps. As such, the concern of attack keeps rising amongst camp
members. To protect ourselves we set out to build a system for authenticating users of our site. This will be a long adventure, but supremely worth it in the end.
Each of us pair program to build login, log-out, and sign-up pages.

Day 5:
The days are blending together, we are so deep in the jungle, it's getting hard to remember which direction we should head in, and it seems the pillagers left us without a compass.
With lack of direction looming over us, we decide to build our main page, so we can display the billboard top 10 songs. Due to the holidays, time is no longer on our side. never the less, we set a new game plan for our site, and began working through our new goals. We were able to create a main page that pulls from an api, but it requires us to first authenticate with spotify. To keep our main page cleaner we hard coded the results, as it does not affect the functionality of our site.

Journal Entry 4:
We woke up to a treacherous sight, our camp has been ransacked by pillagers, and the errors are plentiful. "Well, the camp isn't going to fix its self", we exclaim. We set fourth, fixing
each error from Friday as the sunrises in the East. Once the camp has been pieced back together (all errors have been fixed), we assess our remaining resources. We decide the best use of time will be to finish all of our End points in the back end, to better protect ourselves in the event of pillagers, then to begin work on the Front- End!
- Wish us luck!

Due to malnutrition and lack of basic human needs, our energy has been rather low. While fighting exhaustion, and hunger pains we collectively mustered up the energy to piece together a half legible readme file. We hope to
secure our camp tonight by creating authentication capabilities, updates coming soon... gotta go feed my dog.

Entry 2:
Much was achieved today,
miles of jungle were traversed, we are currently thick in the vines of code. It's humid and muggy here, but we will prevail!
We set out to build an authentication system for our accounts microservice, but the goal was a little too far to reach in one day. We decided to set up camp here for the weekend, with a looming router/authentication error.

We shall trek forward again come Monday morning, my plan is to focus on fixing the router, and Merrick will focus on the authenticator, so we can start making headway again.
I pray the gods will favor us on this journey.
 - signing off

Things were getting spicy, I ran out of water, and I havent had any food for three days... the lights were starting to look dim, never the less, we were still able to push forward, completing the Get all, Update, Get One, and Delete methods for our accounts microservice.


## November 16, 2022

On a dark and dreary night Van, Thinh, Merick, and I set out to use the day for setting up camp... I mean, setting up our Docker YAML file that we used to build our accounts microservice.
We were able to build our first table, run the migrations, set up our routers, set up our connection pool, and made our first POST requests to the accounts database.
Overall today was pretty cool, we used the Live Share VSCode feature to begin our weekly goals together, I hope to use this feature much more in the future!
