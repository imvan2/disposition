Today, We worked as a team:

* Starting our FastAPI app

Van, Thinh, Merick, and I used the day to set up our Docker YAML file
to build our accounts microservice. We were able to build our first table,
run the migrations, set up our routers, set up our connection pool, and
made our first POST requests to the accounts database.

Today was pretty cool, we used the Live Share VSCode feature
to accomplish our weekly goals together, I hope to use this feature much more
in the future!
