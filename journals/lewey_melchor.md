Due to malnutrition and lack of basic human needs, our energy has beeen rather low. While fighting exhaustion, and hunger pains we collectively mustered up the energy to piece together a half legible readme file. We hope to
secure our camp tonight by creating authentication capabilities, updates coming soon... gotta go feed my dog.

Entry 2:
Much was acheived today, miles of jungle were traversed, we are currently thick in the vines of code. It's humid and muggy here, but we will prevail! 
We set out to build an authentication system for our accounts microservice, but the goal was a little too far to reach in one day. We decided to set up camp here for the night, with a looming router/authentication error. 
We shall treck forward again come Monday morning, my plan is to focus on fixing the router, and Merrick will focus on the authenticator, so we can start making headway again. 
I pray the gods will favor us on this journey.

Things were getting spicy, I ran out of water, and I havent had any food for three days... the lights were starting to look dim, never the less, we were still able to push forward, completing the Get all, Update, Get One, and Delete methods for our accounts microservice.

Today, We worked as a team:

* Starting our FastAPI app

On a dark and dreary night Van, Thinh, Merick, and I set out to use the day for setting up camp... I mean, setting up our Docker YAML file that we used to build our accounts microservice.

We were able to build our first table, run the migrations, set up our routers, set up our connection pool, and made our first POST requests to the accounts database.

Overall today was pretty cool, we used the Live Share VSCode feature to accomplish our weekly goals together, I hope to use this feature much more in the future!
