Today we worked on as a group to update the readmme. We added a basic structure layout that will be updated as we build out our application some more.
* Things we've updated
  - Included wire diagrams images
  - Added accounts data model and playlists questions and answers
  - Wrote steps on how to clone and launch application
  - Short description of application

Learned new ways to work on readme, for example linking different readmes into one

We worked as a group to build out our first service, accounts
* Things we've done:
  - Post, update, create, get for accounts
  - Built routers and repository
  - Need to figure out how to do authorization for created users

Had a lot more clarity while working on fastAPI since it's our first time implementing it outside of lectures

We are still on the planning phase of the project, majority of the ideas are flushed out. Needed more time to figure out some of the smaller details like questions for the vibe quiz, how to relate those answers to a playlist, which database are we gonna use.
