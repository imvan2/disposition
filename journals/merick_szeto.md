In the journals, every day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

The date of the entry
A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
A reflection on any design conversations that you had
At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top.


## SAMPLE ENTRY July 9, 2021

Today, I worked on:

* Getting a customer's data for the account page
  with Asa

Asa and I wrote some SQL. We tested it out with
Insomnia and the UI. We had to coordinate with
Petra who was working on the GHI with Azami.

Today, I found the F2/Rename symbol functionality
in Visual Studio Code! It allows me to rename a
variable without causing bugs. I am going to be
using this a lot!
