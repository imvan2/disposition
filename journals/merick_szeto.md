As a bootcamp student, I am determined to succeed. Today, I worked on hiding Spotify keys in the back-end and figuring out browser routers. I also worked on my journals and successfully deployed my app on Gitlab.

# Dec 7, 2022
Today, my group and I finished writing unit tests for our app, including for questions. We also continued working on Continuous Deployment and are almost done with the deployment process.

Today, we focused on improving the history page by reformatting tables and populating it with past personality quiz results. We also added a unit test and fixed pipeline errors for Continuous Deployment, although we still have some errors to iron out.

As a bootcamp student, I am determined to learn and grow. Today, we tackled pipelines and attempted to understand CI/CD better. We also moved the Spotify login to use app login and added a form for app login once the user is logged into Spotify.

As a bootcamp student, I am constantly pushing myself to improve. Today, we were able to successfully implement login and logout functionality. We also made the nav link dynamic, depending on whether the user is logged in or not. The results page after the personality quiz is now working and will populate with a playlist.

Today, we focused on getting the results page to populate with the results from the personality quiz. It was a challenging task, but I am determined to figure it out.

Today, we made progress on the login page and user authentication. If login is successful, the user will be redirected to the results page, otherwise they will be redirected to the signup page. We also implemented frontend authentication.

As a bootcamp student, I am constantly working to improve my skills. Today, we started working on the main page, adding a Top 10 result that currently works with hardcoded data. We need to figure out how to save the result we get from the third-party API in the backend. We also created a table of the Top 10 songs from billboard.

Today, we completed all the endpoints we need for now in the backend, including all CRUD operations. Next, we will start working on the frontend.

As a bootcamp student, I am always looking for ways to improve. Today, we updated the project's README, adding wire diagrams, the accounts data model, the playlist questions and answers, instructions for cloning and launching the app, and a description of the app. We also learned new ways to organize a large README.

# Nov 17, 2021
As a group, we began building our first service: accounts. We implemented CRUD operations for accounts and built the necessary routers and repository. We need to figure out how to handle user authorization.

# Nov 16, 2021
As a bootcamp student, I am constantly facing challenges. Today, I struggled to create a Docker compose.yml file, the first file under migrations, and our first table. I also had a hard time setting up the routers, queries, and making my first post.

Despite these challenges, I am determined to succeed. My group used the live share option in VS Code in order to group code and we learned the importance of the placement of "," and ";" when writing SQL. It was a tough lesson, but I am determined to keep pushing forward.
