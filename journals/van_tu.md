Today, I worked on:

* Creating the get all endpoint with Lewey, Merick, Thinh

Using the FastAPI videos, we created the get all accounts endpoint
working. We also got the update, get one account, and delete an account
to work.

Today, I had a better understanding of how to create the get one
and delete an account endpoint due to the boys' explanations.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up the docker-compose file with Lewey, Merick, Thinh

Using the project setup instructions, we all worked on creating
the necessary files to get fastAPI up and running on port 8000.

Today, we found how to live share using VS code. This is probably
something we will be using when working together.
