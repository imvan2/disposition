## November 30, 2022

Today, I worked on:

* getting the login page to work Lewey, Merick, Thinh

This was one of our harder days. We didn't commit or push anything because our code
was not working as intended so we did not push to Gitlab. We built out the forms for
user signup/login but we had trouble with front-end authentication.

out the backend for a microservice.

something we will be using when working together.
