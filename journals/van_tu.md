Today, I worked on:

* Setting up the docker-compose file with Lewey, Merick, Thinh

Using the project setup instructions, we all worked on creating
the necessary files to get fastAPI up and running on port 8000.

Today, we found how to live share using VS code. This is probably
something we will be using when working together.
